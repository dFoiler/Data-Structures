# Data Structures

I'm using this repository to store my implementations of some data structures. They each have tester files, which are a rough amalgamation of the functions used; do note they are supposed to error out at the end to show that they error out at the end. Nothing to see here.

As a small side note, these implementations---with the exception of the heap---are entirely done from a linked list framework. This is mostly done for ease of programming; e.g., the more standard array implementation of the binary tree requires a minimum of three headaches to get right.
