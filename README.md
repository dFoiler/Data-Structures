# Data Structures

I'm using this repository to store my implementations of some data structures. Some of them have tester files, which are a rough amalgamation of the functions used. Nothing to see here.

As a small side note, these implementations are entirely done from a linked list framework. This is mostly done for ease of programming; e.g., the more standard array implementation of the binary tree requires a minimum of three headaches to get right.
